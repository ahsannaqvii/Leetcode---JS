Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.

A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.

Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "the sky is blue"
Output: "blue is sky the"

/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {string}
 */
var reverseWords = function (s) {
    let splitWords = s.split(' ')
    let reversedArray = splitWords.reverse()
    let res  = []
    for (let i = 0; i <= reversedArray.length - 1; i++) {
        if (reversedArray[i] != '') res.push(reversedArray[i]);
    }
    return res.join(' ')
};
